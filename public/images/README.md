# Images Directory

This directory contains all images for the Call To Action website, organized in the following structure:

- `/logos/` - Client and partner logos
- `/team/` - Team member photos
- `/case-studies/` - Case study featured images
- `/about/` - Images for the About page
- `/services/` - Images for the Services page

## Image Placeholder Usage

For development purposes, if an image is not available, the component will fallback to a placeholder image from https://via.placeholder.com with appropriate dimensions.

## Image Optimization

For production, all images should be:
1. Properly sized for their intended use
2. Compressed to reduce file size
3. Provided in modern formats like WebP where possible
4. Include appropriate alt text for accessibility
